# 🧠 Eye Disease Identifier

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that detects different eye diseases using retinal images. Built with PyTorch and trained on real image data.

## 🚀 Features:
- Image input (retinal images)
- CNN-based classification
- Visual feedback and metrics
- Trained using PyTorch

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Folder Structure:
- `EyeCare/Eye Disease Identifier.ipynb` – main notebook
- `train` – training images
- `test` – testing images

## 🧠 Model Architecture:
- Custom CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Trained for XX epochs with accuracy of ~XX%
